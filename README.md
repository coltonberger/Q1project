Deployed URL: https://brechy.net

Quiz abstract. Take the quiz and it will output a suggested city you should visit.

## Description
Answer the questions and press the 'Discover' button at the bottom of the page. The computer will then generate a suggested travel destination. Click the 'Explore' option on the navbar on the top of the page. From the second page, you can begin to explore the four different cities that could be suggested in the previous quiz. Clicking on one of the four buttons will redirect you to that specific city's tourism related website. Use the custom search bar at the bottom of the page to pull information on flights, hotels, and activities. Finally, share the quiz or website on social media using the provided floating bank of social media buttons.
